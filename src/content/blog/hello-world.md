Welcome to the first blog post on my personal site!

This site was built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), a modern framework for creating static sites with a strong emphasis on simplicity and performance. Astro’s philosophy of making it easy to build fast, lightweight sites resonated with me, making it the perfect choice for this project.

For now, I’m using plain markdown files to create content, but Astro also supports [MDX](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-pages/#markdownmdx-pages), which blends Markdown and JSX for added flexibility. For now I’ve decided to stick with markdown for simplicity.

## Hosting with Cloudflare Pages

The site is hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). One of the best features with cloudflare pages is the github integration for automated deployments, branch/commit deployments, and and easy rollbacks.

To deploy the site, I referenced this [guide](https://tanis.codes/posts/deploy-hugo-website-to-cloudflare/). Although the tutorial focuses on a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site, it follows the same structure as deploying an Astro site.

Cloudflare is starting to be my goto choice for cloud and compute. [It's affordable to start, good developer experience, and scales.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJtOn_Vt1uw)

## Design and Inspiration

The site embraces minimalism, with styling inspired by [bearblog.dev](https://bearblog.dev). The goal was to focus on content and readability.

Check out the [Markdown Kitchen Sink page](/kitchen-sink), where I showcase various features on this site.
